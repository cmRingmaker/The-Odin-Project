# The Odin Project

This repository contains all of the assignments associated with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Every task that is given will be shown, but each section of The Odin Project will have a major project associated with the fundamentals that will be listed below with a link directly to the project that is completed.

Under each section that is completed, I will list notable things that I had learned while working through it.

### <p align='center'>FOUNDATIONS</p>

## HTML Foundations: [Odin Recipes Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Foundations/odin-recipes) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Foundations/odin-recipes/)
*[HTML]*
- Tags and headers are needed to tell search engines how much importance different elements of your page have.
- Using tags such as \<em> or \<strong> will give emphasis on italics or boldness for screen readers, increasing accessibility of the page.
- An alt text for image links is intended to be a descriptive yet concise text that describes the image. Once again improving accessibility, and helping search engines.

## Flexbox: [Landing Page Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Foundations/landing-page) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Foundations/landing-page/)
*[HTML | CSS + Flexbox]*

- display: flex is for the container of your items, while flex items are the children inside the container.
- Flexbox operates with a main axis and cross axis, which change the flow of items depending on the direction you set.
- Flexbox makes worrying about floats practically nonexistant!

## JavaScript Basics: [Rock Paper Scissors Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Foundations/rock-paper-scissors) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Foundations/rock-paper-scissors/)
*[HTML | CSS + Flexbox | JavaScript]*

- With JS, the DOM is easily manipulated with using querySelectors to target specific HTML elements, as well as using event listeners to change the elements.
- Arrays and Objects are powerful ways to store data that can be called later!
- When debugging JS in a browser, following the stack trace is a great way to get to root of the problem.

## JavaScript Basics: [Etch-a-Sketch Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Foundations/etch-a-sketch) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Foundations/etch-a-sketch/)
*[HTML | CSS + Flexbox | JavaScript]*

- The DOM can support a surprising amount of divs being generated!
- Calling functions inside of event listeners allows for more DRY code.
- Session Storage is a powerful way to keep certain elements persisting through reloads.

## JavaScript Basics: [Calculator Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Foundations/calculator) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Foundations/calculator/)
*[HTML | CSS + Flexbox | JavaScript]*

- Manipulating strings is easy!
- Using custom data attributes is another way for HTML and JS to "talk" to each other, to change the DOM.
- When using an ID with .getElementById, you do not need the # sign to choose it, you just simply call the ID name.

### <p align='center'>INTERMEDIATE</p>

## Forms: [Sign-up Form](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Intermediate/sign-up-form) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Intermediate/sign-up-form/)
*[HTML | CSS + Flexbox | JavaScript]*

- Forms are a powerful way to get data directly from a user.
- You can validate inputs directly on the form itself, or in JavaScript.
- It is important to convey the information that you actually need from the user, before they try to submit the form.

## Admin Dashboard: [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Intermediate/admin-dashboard) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Intermediate/admin-dashboard/)
*[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript]*

- Creating the base layout of a site with Grid is wonderfully easy.
- You can have grids inside grids, or even flexbox inside grids!
- Making grids be responsive to the page resizing is not only easy, but has the benefit of not having to write tons of mediaqueries.

### <p align='center'>FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT</p>

## Library: [Library Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/library) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/library/)
*[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript]*

- Utilizing localstorage on the client-side is very useful.
- Writing classes that can be edited to quickly change a lot of functionalty is incredibly powerful.
- Modals are fun to build!

## Tic-Tac-Toe: [Tic-Tac-Toe Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/tic-tac-toe) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/tic-tac-toe/)
*[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript]*

- Using the Class syntax (although they are just objects in JS) is a good way to have organized, readable code.
- OOP principles such as encapsulation and abstraction are useful for keeping important data out of harms way by not letting you change it.
- Not everything has to be darkmode.

## Restaurant Page: [Restaurant Page](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/restaurant-page) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/restaurant-page/dist/)

_[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript | Webpack]_

- Classes are very useful to make utility tools.
- Webpack has a steep learning curve, but is very flexible and powerful once you get going with it.
- CSS natively supports nesting and it makes more sense to me to look at pages like I would look at a JS function, lumping all the relevant info together.
