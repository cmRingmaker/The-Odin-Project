# The Odin Project
*I am helping teach a friend as he makes his journey into Web Development, we are working our way through The Odin Project and as we complete projects I will also be putting my code up so we can compare with each other.*

This repository contains all of the assignments associated with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Every task that is given will be shown, but each section of The Odin Project will have a major project associated with the fundamentals that will be listed below with a link directly to the project that is completed.

Under each section that is completed, I will list notable things that I had learned while working through it.

* Tags and headers are needed to tell search engines how much importance different elements of your page have.
* Using tags such as \<em> or \<strong> will give emphasis on italics or boldness for screen readers, increasing accessibility of the page.
* An alt text for image links is intended to be a descriptive yet concise text that describes the image. Once again improving accessibility, and helping search engines.

* display: flex is for the container of your items, while flex items are the children inside the container.
* Flexbox operates with a main axis and cross axis, which change the flow of items depending on the direction you set.
* Flexbox makes worrying about floats practically nonexistant!

* With JS, the DOM is easily manipulated with using querySelectors to target specific HTML elements, as well as using event listeners to change the elements.
* Arrays and Objects are powerful ways to store data that can be called later!
* When debugging JS in a browser, following the stack trace is a great way to get to root of the problem.
