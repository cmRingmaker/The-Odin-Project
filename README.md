# The Odin Project

This repository contains all of the assignments associated with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Every task that is given will be shown, but each section of The Odin Project will have a major project associated with the fundamentals that will be listed below with a link directly to the project that is completed.

Under each section that is completed, I will list notable things that I had learned while working through it.

## HTML Foundations: [Odin Recipes Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/odin-recipes) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/odin-recipes/)

- Tags and headers are needed to tell search engines how much importance different elements of your page have.
- Using tags such as \<em> or \<strong> will give emphasis on italics or boldness for screen readers, increasing accessibility of the page.
- An alt text for image links is intended to be a descriptive yet concise text that describes the image. Once again improving accessibility, and helping search engines.

## Flexbox: [Landing Page Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/landing-page) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/landing-page/)

- display: flex is for the container of your items, while flex items are the children inside the container.
- Flexbox operates with a main axis and cross axis, which change the flow of items depending on the direction you set.
- Flexbox makes worrying about floats practically nonexistant!

## JavaScript: [Rock Paper Scissors Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/rock-paper-scissors) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/rock-paper-scissors/)

- With JS, the DOM is easily manipulated with using querySelectors to target specific HTML elements, as well as using event listeners to change the elements.
- Arrays and Objects are powerful ways to store data that can be called later!
- When debugging JS in a browser, following the stack trace is a great way to get to root of the problem.

## JavaScript: [Etch-a-Sketch Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/etch-a-sketch) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/etch-a-sketch/)

- The DOM can support a surprising amount of divs being generated!
- Calling functions inside of event listeners allows for more DRY code.
- Session Storage is a powerful way to keep certain elements persisting through reloads.

## JavaScript: [Calculator Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/calculator) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/calculator/)

- Manipulating strings is easy!
- Using custom data attributes is another way for HTML and JS to "talk" to each other, to change the DOM.
- When using an ID with .getElementById, you do not need the # sign to choose it, you just simply call the ID name.
