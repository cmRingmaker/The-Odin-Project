## Library: [Library Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/library) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/library/)

_[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript]_

- Utilizing localstorage on the client-side is very useful.
- Writing classes that can be edited to quickly change a lot of functionalty is incredibly powerful.
- Modals are fun to build!

## Tic-Tac-Toe: [Tic-Tac-Toe Code](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/tic-tac-toe) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/tic-tac-toe/)

_[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript]_

- Using the Class syntax (although they are just objects in JS) is a good way to have organized, readable code.
- OOP principles such as encapsulation and abstraction are useful for keeping important data out of harms way by not letting you change it.
- Not everything has to be darkmode.

## Restaurant Page: [Restaurant Page](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/restaurant-page) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/restaurant-page/dist/)

_[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript | Webpack]_

- Classes are very useful to make utility tools.
- Webpack has a steep learning curve, but is very flexible and powerful once you get going with it.
- CSS natively supports nesting and it makes more sense to me to look at pages like I would look at a JS function, lumping all the relevant info together.

## Todo-List: [Todo-List](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/tree/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/todo-list) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/todo-list/dist/)
*[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript | Webpack]*
- Animating in CSS is pretty straightforward and fun.
- Using .filter() is a strong option for quickly getting information you need from array.
- HTMLs Dialog is a fantastic way to create custom popups.

## Weather App: [Weather App](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/quick-weather) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/quick-weather/)
*[HTML | CSS + Grid + Flexbox | JavaScript | Webpack]*
- THe usage of ASync code allows single-threaded JavaScript to continue operating without waiting for those async functions to finish.
- Utilizing API's by calling for data from a server is a great way to store and display data client-side.
- Array destructuring is wonderful! No more writing array[0] array[1], etc.. when dealing with small arrays.

## Recursion: [Recursion](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/blob/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/recursion/fibonacci.js) | [Merge Sort](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/blob/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/recursion/merge-sort.js)
*[JavaScript]*
- Recursion is fun, but it will have a performance cost.
- Merge Sort uses a divide and conquer technique to continously split the problem in half, and then sort it.
- One way or the other, you're paying in time or space! Choose your battles.

## Linked Lists: [Linked Lists](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/blob/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/linked-lists/linked-list.js) | [Tests](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/blob/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/linked-lists/main.js)
*[JavaScript | Node.js]*
- Linked Lists are similar to arrays but aren't stored in consecutive chunks of memory.
- Writing tests is important, and I certainly need to get better at it.
- Traversing lists is a bit confusing at first but it becomes pretty fun.

## HashMap: [HashMap](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/The-Odin-Project/blob/main/Full%20Stack%20JavaScript/JavaScript/hashmap/hashmap.js)
*[JavaScript]*
- Hashing is a great way to get unique ID's.
- Hashmaps dynamically scale when more room is needed in order to reduce chances of collisions.
- On average, a hashmap has an 0(1) time complexity, making it incredibly efficient.

## Binary Search Trees: [Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/cmRingmaker/balanced-BST) | [Demo](https://cmringmaker.github.io/balanced-BST/)
*[HTML | CSS | JavaScript]*
- Utilizing recursion for BST methods felt very good to write.
- Setting default parameters makes my code feel a little neater.
- Actually fully understanding now how a BST works is exciting, considering at the start I was pretty lost.
